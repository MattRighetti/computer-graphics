# Cat Wall Watch

## Goal
Design a cat wall watch. The clock hands must correspond to the current time. The cat must move its eyes and tail.

### Other infos about the obj/textures
Use the texture for the cat's body and eyes.
Use vertex color for the tail (black) and the 
clock hands (white).
The objPositions.js file contains the local matrices
to place the parts of the cat in the correct position
with respect to the body.
